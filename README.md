# FoodTrack Smartphone Application

**FoodTrack** is a system that aims to reduce consumer food wastage by
encouraging the proper storage of food and discouraging the overbuying of
groceries. This is accomplished through a camera module placed in a consumer's
fridge taking pictures and uploading them to a server to be analyzed. From
there, the image and resulting data are uploaded to written to a database and
the image uploaded to a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) in some way or
another, where this smartphone app reads its data from. We hope that by reducing food wastage at the individual level, we can make an impact
that will last.
